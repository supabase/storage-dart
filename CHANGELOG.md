## [1.0.0-dev.2]

## [1.0.0-dev.1]

- BREAKING: error is now thrown instead of returned within the responses.
Before:
```dart
final response = await ....;
if (response.hasError) {
  final error = response.error!;
  // handle error
} else {
  final data = response.data!;
  // handle data
}
```

Now:
```dart
try {
  final data = await ....;
} on StorageException catch (error) {
  // handle storage errors
} catch (error) {
  // handle other errors
}
